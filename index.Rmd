<p style="font-family:times;font-size:12pt;">
Topic: Accuracy assessment and improvement of tree localization algorithm       
Supervisor: Smart Farm Sensing. BV  Laurens Bierens 
</p>

The company desires to automate the detection of the tree geo-location by integrating GIS data, for instance from aerial photographs and satellite images. It is essential to examine how well the algorithm functions and how the algorithm can be incorporated for company future usage. A testing algorithm (TSVD) is created in this research for examining the accuracy of SVD algorithm. 


The practical step by step instructions is presented so that the company can use the SVD algorithm. Results of this research show that SVD algorithm can bring nearly 85% accuracy of detected points in the farms which are regularly planted with young and medium grown trees. For farms with a regular planted pattern but with dense and mature plants, the algorithm can currently reach 50% accuracy. The report also reveals that by using TSVD at a small sample area first, and then apply the resulting outcome into larger study area, is an efficient and applicable way for the company to deal with projects from large farms/organization in the future.

Topic: Spatial Analysis and Visualization of Triadic Crop Variety Traits in Central America

**Abstract**

A rapid increase in population, urbanization, and climate change has put huge pressures on all aspects of society, and in particular agriculture. These pressures lead to a massive demand of agriculture products which is increasingly difficult to meet due to climate change, or more specifically the challenges climate change introduces to farmers. _**Seeds for Needs**_ is a global initiative from the Bioversity International Research Center which is aiming to help farmers adapt better to climate change through the use of agriculture biodiversity. The method employed by this Seeds for Needs initiative is called _**‘Tricot’ (Triadic Comparisons of Technologies)**_ and consists of a farm-specific comparisons between three randomly-assigned crop varieties (sampled from a large set) which are then also compared to local varieties. **Numerous environmental datasets were linked in a spatially explicit way for each observation (e.g. elevation, temperature, and water balance), this was possible because all the farms were geo-located.** These datasets were used to produce valuable information about the interactions between crop variety performance and crop growing environment. The method employed here included the Hargreaves method which calculated the necessary evapotranspiration, and ultimately the water balance. **The _Plackett-Luce statistical model_ was then used to predict crop varieties performance under different environmental situations using model based recursive partitioning of environmental covariates.** As the data for these covariates were spatially explicit and continuous, all model results were able to be visualized by an interactive webpage which allowed farmers to assess appropriate crops for their particular farms.
